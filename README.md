### Interfaces Branch

This branch needs to be sorted out before we can proceed.

The following issues have been raised:
* All source code needs to be moved from **main/** to **test/**.
* There is duplicate code within **main/**
* Once the directory structure has been sorted out and the duplicate code removed we can assign implementation of interfaces
to each team member.
