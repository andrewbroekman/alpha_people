### PostgreSQL Connection Branch

This code is set up to work with PostgreSQL and JPA with correct ORM and Persistence files.

* For testing purposes however a **new** branch needs to be set up with Derby. (feature/derby_connection)
* Make sure your IDE is properly configured with PostgreSQL if you're working on this branch, else configure your IDE with Derby.
